# House_priceing_ML01
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project leverages machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, and more. The prediction system is built using Python, Flask, and a set of machine learning models trained on a dataset of house prices.
