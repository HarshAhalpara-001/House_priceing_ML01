# House Price Predictor

## Overview
House Price Predictor is a web application designed to predict the selling price of a house based on its features and the selling prices of nearby houses. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, it analyzes real estate data to provide accurate price estimates.

## Features
- **Input Form**: Users can input various features of the house, including location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, etc.
- **Prediction Model**: The application employs a multi-variable linear regression model trained on nearby houses' data to forecast the selling price.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Predictions are generated instantaneously, enabling users to promptly assess the estimated price of a house.
- **User-friendly Interface**: With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, the application provides a seamless experience for users.

## How It Works
1. **Input Data**: Users input the features of the house they are interested in, such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
2. **Finding Nearest Houses**: The application identifies the 15 closest houses to the given location using a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm.
3. **Training the Model**: Based on the features of these nearest houses, a multi-variable linear regression model is trained to predict selling prices.
4. **Making Predictions**: The model predicts the selling price of the input house based on its features.
5. **Displaying Predictions**: The predicted price is displayed to the user, providing valuable insights for real estate decisions.

## Deployment
The application can be deployed locally or on a web server using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform.

## Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-price-predictor.git`
2. Run the backend server: `python app.py`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the frontend.
