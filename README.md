# House Price Predictor

Overview
House Price Predictor is a web application that predicts the selling price of a house based on its features and the selling prices of nearby houses. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze real estate data and provide accurate price estimates.

Features
Input Form: Users can input various features of the house, such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, etc.
Prediction Model: The application uses a multi-variable linear regression model trained on nearby houses' data to predict the selling price.
Real-time Prediction: Predictions are made in real-time, allowing users to quickly assess the estimated price of a house.
User-friendly Interface: The interface is intuitive and easy to use, providing users with a seamless experience.
How It Works
Input Data: Users input the features of the house they are interested in, including location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
Finding Nearest Houses: The application identifies the 15 closest houses to the given location using a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm.
Training the Model: Based on the features of these nearest houses, a multi-variable linear regression model is trained to predict selling prices.
Making Predictions: The model predicts the selling price of the input house based on its features.
Displaying Predictions: The predicted price is displayed to the user, providing valuable insights for real estate decisions.
Deployment
The application can be deployed locally or on a web server using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform.
